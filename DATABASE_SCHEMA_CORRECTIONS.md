# DATABASE SCHEMA CORRECTIONS SUMMARY

## Issue Resolved: Incorrect Field References

### Problem:
- Used `p.date_added` in queries, but the actual field name is `p.created`
- Mixed use of table aliases (`p`) vs full table names (`shop_products`)

### Root Cause:
- I incorrectly assumed the field was called `date_added` when building the integrated shop pages
- The original shop system uses `created` as the timestamp field for when products were added

### Fields Corrected:

#### ✅ Fixed in `products.php`:
- **Old**: `p.date_added DESC/ASC` 
- **New**: `p.created DESC/ASC`

#### ✅ Fixed in `shop.php`:
- **Old**: `ORDER BY p.date_added DESC`
- **New**: `ORDER BY p.created DESC`

#### ✅ Fixed in `shop-search.php`: 
- **Old**: `'newest' => 'p.date_added DESC'`
- **New**: `'newest' => 'p.created DESC'`

#### ✅ Fixed in `product.php`:
- **Old**: `<?=date('M j, Y', strtotime($product['date_added']))?>`
- **New**: `<?=date('M j, Y', strtotime($product['created']))?>`

### Your Questions Answered:

#### Q: "Did you add date_added for a reason?"
**A**: No, this was my mistake. I incorrectly assumed the field was called `date_added` when it's actually called `created` in the original shop system database schema.

#### Q: "Do I need to change my database table to add that column?"
**A**: **No, you don't need to change anything in your database.** The `created` field already exists and that's what the original shop system uses. Your database is correct.

#### Q: "Is it not important?"
**A**: The field itself is important for sorting products by date, but the correct field name is `created`, not `date_added`.

### Database Schema Reference:

Based on the original shop system, the `shop_products` table uses these key fields:
- `id` - Product ID
- `title` - Product name  
- `description` - Product description
- `short_description` - Brief description
- `price` - Product price
- `rrp` - Recommended retail price
- `quantity` - Stock quantity
- `created` - **Date/time when product was added** ⭐
- `weight` - Product weight
- `url_slug` - SEO-friendly URL
- `product_status` - Status (1 = active)
- `sku` - Stock keeping unit

### Table Alias vs Full Names:

You're right that table aliases can be confusing:
- **Alias style**: `p.created` (where `p` = alias for `shop_products`)
- **Full name style**: `shop_products.created` 

The original shop system uses aliases for brevity, but full table names are clearer. Both work the same way - it's a style preference.

### Status: ✅ RESOLVED
- All field references now use correct `created` field
- No database changes required
- All shop pages now use proper field names matching original schema
- Ready for production use
