# Phase 0 Consolidated Summary (Generated 2025-08-20)

## Scope
Hardening and standardizing the database‑driven settings system: central validation, CSRF protection, method ↔ schema alignment, removal of brittle heuristics, and establishing a repeatable pattern for all settings forms.

## Completed
- Added hotfix getter/update methods & field mappings in `SettingsManager` for SEO + Account settings.
- Introduced `SecurityHelper` (CSRF token lifecycle + generic payload validation).
- Refactored `seo_settings.php` & `account_settings.php` with CSRF + centralized validation spec and field length / range checks.
- Implemented DB‐based completion logic in `settings_dash.php` (replaced file-size heuristic).
- Drafted `settings_coverage_matrix.md` enumerating tables, forms, methods, and gaps.

## In Progress
- Contact settings refactor (field name unification + social media segregation) [NOW].
- Branding settings form stub (planned) to surface identity & color tables.
- Standard audit reason taxonomy and cache invalidation review.

## Core Tables & Status (excerpt)
| Table | UI/Form | Method(s) | Status |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| setting_business_identity | (branding form TBD) | updateBusinessIdentity | Pending UI
| setting_branding_colors | (branding form TBD) | updateBrandingColors | Pending UI
| setting_contact_info | business_contact_form | updateContactInfo | Refactor in progress
| setting_social_media | (split from contact) | generic updateSetting | Pending integration
| setting_accounts_config | account_settings.php | get/updateAccountSettings | Refactored
| setting_seo_global | seo_settings.php | get/updateSeoSettings | Refactored
| blog settings tables | (future blog forms) | blog getters/update* | Pending update methods

## Patterns Established
1. CSRF: `SecurityHelper::getCsrfToken(form_key)` + hidden input + rotate after POST.
2. Validation: Declarative `$spec` passed to `SecurityHelper::validatePayload()`.
3. DB Mapping: Map UI field names → DB columns before invoking SettingsManager update.
4. Completion Metrics: Query table counts rather than file content length.

## Pending Gaps
- Social media settings separated from contact form (needs own update flow / table integration).
- Unimplemented blog update methods (features, comments, SEO, social) for symmetry.
- Consistent audit reason strings; add enumerated reason codes.
- Cache expiry per category (branding/contact/seo) vs full clear.
- Role-based form access matrix normalization.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Finish contact form refactor (CSRF + validation + field mapping + optional social update).
2. Add branding settings stub (identity + colors + fonts display) using new pattern.
3. Develop small helper endpoint or CLI script to output completeness percentages per settings category.
4. Add test harness / diagnostic script to verify round‑trip persistence for each form field.

## Deferral & Rationale
- Encryption for sensitive config (payment/email) deferred until base pattern stable.
- Blog settings forms postponed to Phase 1 to avoid scope creep.

## Risks
- Inconsistent legacy field names (primary_* vs contact_*)—addressed via mapping shim now; recommend eventual UI rename for clarity.
- Potential stale caches after partial updates—introduce fine-grained cache keys in Phase 1.

## Suggested Commit Message
"Phase 0: security & settings hardening (SecurityHelper, CSRF+validation for SEO/Accounts, DB-based dashboard, coverage matrix, contact mapping WIP)"
