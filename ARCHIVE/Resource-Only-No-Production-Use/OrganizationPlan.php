GWS UNIVERSAL HYBRID APP - MODULARIZATION & ORGANIZATION PLAN
Universal Plan 
Last Updated: August 7, 2025
Current Status: In Progress - Editor Integration Phase
============================================================

RECENT CHANGES & CURRENT STATE:
------------------------------
1. Rich Text Editor Integration
   ✓ Replaced TinyMCE with Summernote editor
   ✓ Implemented in content_settings.php
   ✓ Added to service descriptions
   ✓ Added to feature descriptions
   ✓ Configured with Bootstrap 5 compatibility
   ✓ Properly sequenced jQuery and Summernote resources

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Complete Editor Integration
   - Test content saving/loading across all editor instances
   - Verify HTML handling in all editor areas
   - Add rich text capabilities to remaining content areas

2. Settings System Enhancement
   - Implement unified settings saving mechanism
   - Add validation for rich text content
   - Create backup system for editor content

Original Plan Below:
-------------------

1. SETTINGS & CONFIGURATION STRUCTURE

A. Universal Settings
- private/gws-universal-config.php: Core config (paths, DB, global includes, branding, etc.)
- private/gws-universal-functions.php: Universal helper functions
- private/gws-universal-branding.css: Universal CSS variables and base styles

B. Application-Specific Settings
- Each app (blog, accounts, client portal, etc.) gets its own settings/config file:
  - public_html/blog_system/settings/blog-config.php
  - public_html/accounts_system/settings/accounts-config.php
  - public_html/client_portal/settings/client-config.php
  - etc.

C. Private/Public/SEO Settings
- assets/includes/settings/meta-config.php: SEO/meta tags
- assets/includes/settings/public-settings.php: Public-facing settings
- assets/includes/settings/private-settings.php: Private/internal settings
- assets/includes/settings/seo-settings.php: SEO-specific settings

D. Branding
- private/gws-universal-branding.css: Universal branding
- assets/branding/business-branding.css: Business-specific overrides
- Each app can have its own branding CSS if needed

2. MODULARIZATION & BEST PRACTICES

A. Directory Structure
- Keep each application in its own folder with its own settings, assets, and branding
- Universal files (config, functions, branding) live in private/ and assets/branding/

B. Settings Loading
- Each app loads:
  - Universal config (require_once $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/private/gws-universal-config.php';)
  - Its own config/settings file
  - Universal branding CSS + app-specific branding CSS

C. Admin Center
- Central admin panel (public_html/admin/) manages:
  - All settings files (universal + app-specific)
  - Branding (upload logos, set colors, etc.)
  - SEO/meta settings
  - User roles/access
- Use forms to update settings files (write to PHP/JSON/config files)
- Optionally, use a database for settings that change often

D. CSS Organization
- Universal CSS: gws-universal-branding.css (imported everywhere)
- App-specific CSS: Each app has its own CSS file for overrides
- Business branding: assets/branding/business-branding.css for business-specific changes

E. Adding/Removing Applications
- To add: Copy app folder, update config, add to admin center
- To remove: Delete app folder, remove from admin center
- Universal config and functions never depend on any single app

3. SCALABLE CUSTOMIZATION WORKFLOW

1. Clone Template to New Business
   - Copy workspace to cPanel
   - Update universal config (business name, colors, DB, etc.)
   - Update business branding CSS
   - Use admin center to set app-specific settings

2. Customize Applications
   - Enable/disable apps via admin center
   - Update app settings via forms (no code changes)
   - Upload branding assets/logos via admin

3. SEO & Public Settings
   - Edit meta/SEO settings via admin
   - Public/private settings managed via admin forms

4. Future Growth
   - Add new apps by creating a new folder, config, and admin form
   - Universal config and admin center automatically pick up new apps

4. IMPLEMENTATION STATUS AND NEXT STEPS

============================================================

ENHANCED SYSTEM-WIDE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
============================================================

4. DATABASE ARCHITECTURE AND NAMING CONVENTIONS

A. Table Naming Standards
- Universal Standard: {application_name}_{table_purpose}
- Examples:
  * accounts_accounts (main user accounts)
  * blog_posts, blog_comments, blog_categories
  * tickets_tickets, tickets_comments, tickets_categories
  * events_events, events_registrations
  * shop_products, shop_orders, shop_categories

B. Benefits of Prefixed Naming:
- Namespace Separation: Prevents conflicts between applications
- Clear Ownership: Immediately identifies which application owns each table
- Database Organization: Logical grouping in database management tools
- Scalability: Easier to manage as more applications are added
- Backup/Restore: Can target specific application data

C. Migration Strategy for Existing Tables:
- Audit Current: Identify tables that don't follow convention
- Impact Assessment: Check cross-application references
- Gradual Migration: Update table names during application updates
- Foreign Key Updates: Update all references and relationships

5. APPLICATION INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

A. Admin Integration Standards
- Include Pattern: All admin apps use ../assets/includes/main.php
- Authentication: Unified admin authentication across all apps
- Navigation: Consistent admin navigation with app-specific submenus
- Styling: All apps follow canonical admin styling standards

B. Database Integration Standards
