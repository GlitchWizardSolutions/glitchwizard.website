✅ signature-pad.js
Purpose: JS utility to handle drawing and exporting signatures from the canvas.

Status: ✅ Still needed unless the script is embedded inline in your pages (as I’ve been doing). Externalizing is smart for reuse and easier maintenance.

Action: Keep it if you prefer cleaner pages or reuse across multiple files.
